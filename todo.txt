Dear ImGui light remote:
    auto generated (de)serialization code from function declarations
    -format: {function id, constant size paramters, variable size paramters (eg. string, ImVec2 array)}
     -easy to reserve space in a buffer
     -need to send an object id as an additional paramter
    -own parser because the grammar is really simple

Server:
    Graphical output sent as ImDrawList calls
    -ImDrawList then contains just an id
        -don't send the id for each call, instead create a function switch_draw_list(id)
    -no way to implement AddCallback function
    Need a way to send fonts and images to the client
    ImFontGlyph still needs to have AdvanceX for CalcTextSize
    -but can drop all the coordinates, ie. 38 -> 6 bytes per character
    -extracted into ImFont::IndexAdvanceX and ImFont::IndexLookup
     both are sparse
    -maybe do font handling only on the client and only ship back these two arrays
     use URLs instead of storing the font file?
    Sends a message to indicate end of frame and the order in which ImDrawLists should be rendered
    Recieves input messages and aggregates them for use in the next frame
Client:
    Runs ImDrawList functions with received paramters
    Renders on the reception of end-frame message
    Sends input messages
    Builds up font data along/for the server
    
todo:
decide if it's better to use clang or continue this way

finish basic tokenizer
basic parser
improve tokenizer and parser to supportt c++ attributes
serialization code generator
improve tokenizer and parser to chow down entire imgui source files
-preprocessor directives
-variable defenitions
-skipping string literals (even in curly blocks)
-don't dread on it, hard to skip parts can be ifdefed out
improve code generator to insert generated code into source files with preprocessor ifs
